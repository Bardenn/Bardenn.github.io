Below is a collection of blog post ideas, for me to note down (and for friends to bug me about)

- Telemetry System writeup
- Ground station writeup
- SaudPass writeup (whenever this actually gets done)
- XV6 Post
- XV6 Shell writeup (yuh)
- NixOS pain post (kill it with hammers)
- Hugo editor, wysiwyg-style editor that runs client side, and pushes updates to git
